A simple web app to display two counters in two div boxes. I built this to pratice my Javascript and to make some Ajax calls. I used Flask with Sqlite3 for the backend. Exposed /get_counter and /increment/rowid as endpoints for Ajax consumption. /get_counter takes query string parameters counter, increment to set the db and returns the new rowid.
